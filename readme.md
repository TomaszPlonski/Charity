# Charity
This application allows you to donate unnecessary things to charities
I used: Java, Spring Boot with (JPA, Validation, Web and Security starters), MySQL and lombock.

# What is my purpose?
The application allows logged in users to order a courier for the specified time and address in order to collect gifts for charity.

# Bacis functionalites
Available to all not logged users:
- View of the main page describing what the whole action is about
- Sending an email with comments to the owner of the application
- New user registration. To confirm the registration, it is necessary to click on the link sent in the e-mail

Available to logged users:
- Donating through a five-step form

## Testing:
Login data: email: test@test.com password: test123

# Scopes that can be developed in the future
- login and crud for the administrator
- internationalization is on, I just need to translate the content and add placeholders :)
- basic password validation is enabled. I will add a more advanced one
- password reminder<br>

<b>Therefore any comments and advice will be appreciated</b>
